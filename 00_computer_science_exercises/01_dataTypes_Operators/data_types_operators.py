# Data Types and Operators, Andrew Patton, v0.0

# Fundamental Data Types
# String - str - Sequence of letter, numbers, spaces, or other characters.
# Strings in Python are inside ' ' or " "
# idc if you use ' ' or " " just be consistent.

# Boolean - bool - True or False values.

# Float - float - any number with a decimal, +/-, including 0.0.

# Integers - int - any whole numbers, +/-, including 0.

# Data types are stored in VARIABLES.
# A variable is basically a bucket with a name to put data into.
# VARIABLE NAMES SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT DATA IS BEING STORED IN IT.
# VARIABLES CANNOT START WITH A NUMBER
